This CLI tool helps reduce manual labor input by automating the task of turning a single-key multiple-column layout, to a simple single-key two-column layout. It allows multiple extractions from different sheets of the same file. It also helps identify the extraction by adding a custom tag column that can easily be removed.

This CLI tool is only available for Windows systems.
It is currently only available in Spanish.

The tool uses the following modules: openpyxl, colorama and console menu; as well as other standard libraries.


The basic functionality is illustrated here:
