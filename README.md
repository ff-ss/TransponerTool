This CLI tool helps reduce manual labor input by automating the task of turning a single-key multiple-column layout, to a simple single-key two-column layout. It allows multiple extractions from different sheets of the same file. It also helps identify the extraction by adding a custom tag column that can easily be removed.

This CLI tool is  available for **Windows** and **macOS / Linux ** systems.
It is currently *only* available in **English**.

The tool uses the following modules: openpyxl, colorama and console menu; as well as other standard libraries.

## Releases:
You can download the Windows executable standalone file **[here](https://github.com/ff-ss/TrasponerTool/raw/master/source/windows/TrasponerToolv3.2.exe)**, the macOS/Linux file **[here](https://github.com/ff-ss/TrasponerTool/raw/master/source/mac-unix/TrasponerToolv3.2.dmg)** *or* you can choose to build it yourself (you will need the required modules).

The basic functionality is illustrated here:
> In a key-multiple value table; TT will record each key with each of its values in individual rows. TT does not check for validity of data: so make sure that your data is clean before transposing.

**Remember that the program will stop collecting data when a fully empty row is met.**
