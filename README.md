# TransponerTool


This CLI tool helps reduce manual labor input by automating the task of turning a single-key multiple-column layout, to a simple single-key two-column layout. It allows multiple extractions from different sheets of the same file. It also helps identify the extraction by adding a custom tag column that can easily be removed.

This CLI tool is *only* available for **Windows** systems.
It is currently *only* available in **Spanish**.

The tool uses the following modules: openpyxl, colorama and console menu; as well as other standard libraries.

## Releases:
You can download the executable standalone file [here](https://github.com/ff-ss/TransponerTool/raw/master/TransponerTool-2.1.2.exe), **or** you can choose to build the exe yourself (you will need the required modules).

The basic functionality is illustrated here:
